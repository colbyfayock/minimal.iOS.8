#### Requesting Icons
Use Github Issues if possible, otherwise [hit me up on Twitter (@colbyfayock)](http://twitter.com/colbyfayock) or use the contact button that you can find in the [Cydia repo](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.modmyi.minimalios8/)

Note: If the app is paid and I do not already own the app, I will request that you either send me the Bundle Identifier in addition to the filenames of the icons to be themed, or simply gift me the app, at which point I will ensure it's thoroughly themed.

#### Development Releases
Add source [http://cydia.fay.io](http://cydia.fay.io) on Cydia!

#### Using minimal.iOS.8 Icons for New Theme Creation
Everyone is free to use these icons in their own themes, however, it would be super appreciated to throw in any kind of attribution linking to [my Twitter (@colbyfayock)](http://twitter.com/colbyfayock)
